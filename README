	QDFinScripts: Financial Programming Scripts in Python

	OVERVIEW:

	This is a set of financial programming scripts written in Python and OpenSourced.  They were originally written as the start of a financial calculator and 
	data visualisations, and to give @funcrandm a chance to move to a modern scripting language, and away from scripting and highlevel languages like PHP/Perl/C# for general tools work. The scripts will eventually cover:

		Basic statistics, financial constants and discounting
		Swaps and Options
		Interest Rate Instruments, including Bond Calculations, Futures, and Forward Rate Agreements
		Forex
		Curve visualisations
